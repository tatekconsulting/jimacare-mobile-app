# 🚀 Setting Up JimaCare Provider & Client Apps

## ✅ What's Been Created

1. **Provider App** - `C:\Users\lalyk\Downloads\flutter_app\` (your current app)
2. **Client App** - `C:\Users\lalyk\Downloads\client_app\` (newly created)

Both apps will connect to your Laravel backend at:
- **Backend Location:** `C:\Users\lalyk\Downloads\jimacare.com\jimacare.com\`
- **API Base URL:** `https://jimacare.com/api/v1` (or local: `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1`)

## 📱 Next Steps

I'll now:
1. ✅ Configure Provider App (current app) for carers
2. ✅ Configure Client App for clients  
3. ✅ Set up shared code structure
4. ✅ Connect both to your Laravel backend
5. ✅ Build role-specific features
